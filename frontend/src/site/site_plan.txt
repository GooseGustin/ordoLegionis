- Praesidium:
    - User can go to Praesidia tab for a list of curia and praesidia he's member to. Here user can easily create new meeting and view current report for any praesidia 
    - In creating a new meeting, the user will create a Meeting, a FinancialRecord, and the selected Works, all associated to the Meeting object. Prevent creation of empty meetings and such.
    - Inside the Praesidium details user can edit praesidium details, edit worklists, edit reports, view all meetings if member or manager
- Social

Problems:
    - Calendar, current month having 2 days selected at the same time 
    - WorkList, can't edit worklist -- handled 
    - WorkList, can create multiple works of the same name
    - ReportForm, selecting submision and last submision dates is buggy, leading to misleading prepdata
    - ReportPrepGetView, last_submission_date is being updated incorrectly
    - Users can create empty social objects and reminders and announcements 
    - Images in posts and announcements need a proper bootstrap component to resize appropriately
